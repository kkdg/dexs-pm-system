<strong>Attention! This plugin is currently in a beta phase, please report some bugs! Thanks for your help!</strong>

Our PM (Private Messages) System provides your Community a personal communication among one another, but only if you allow there the Access to the System! You can configure 6 Permission Settings per WP-Role, i.a. the max number of pm's, the permit for the Use of images in a message and the Access to the Front End - the Back End and also on the completely PM System. Also you can include and exclude individual users by their user id!

Our PM System supports a eMail Notification as soon as the user receive a new message! You can de/activate and configure this System completely, and also all users can disable/enable the Notification for new pm's for himself!

But that's not all what our plugin can do, download and test it and send us your ideas and suggestions for improvement. We will try the best possible way to implement your proposals, to get a better pm system plugin for everyone. Thank you!
